# Fundamentals of Robotics @ SRMIST
This repository is a part of course 15MH301 "Fundamentals of Robotics" at SRMIST (June 2019 - November 2019). It hosts the code snippets for simulating and understanding the fundamentals of robotics. These snippets have been tested in MATLAB R2018a with Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB Release 10.
